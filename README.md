## Angular CLI
This project is built on Angular CLI, so make sure you've got a compatible NodeJS version installed.

## Project Setup
1. Clone the repository from GitLab
2. Navigate to the project directory on your hard drive (NodeJs CMD or via internal terminal for specified IDE)
3. Make sure you are in the directory where the `package.json` file is located
4. Run the command `npm install` as the `node_modules` directory isn't supplied in the repository
5. Start the development server by typing `ng serve` --- See the Development server section below for more.

## Development server
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
Make sure you are in the `src` directory before running `ng serve` otherwise it won't work.
